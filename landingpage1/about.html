                 <h1>about</h1>
                 <p class="part1">The idea for Quouch came to me, Nora, in June 2021 when I was sitting on the couch with my friend Josi and we started talking about the "old" Couchsurfing times - and also why we stopped using it at some point. Instead of the promised couch, a host then suddenly only has his own double bed. Or: You have a good conversation and suddenly the host asks if he can kiss you. In general, women experience about twice as much sexual harassment as men. And couchsurfing is of course a particularly delicate space, since you are in the host's personal space and often in a relationship of gratitude and dependence, which favors it. In one study, female couchsurfers talk about their experiences. For example, Rachel, a 24-year-old Taiwanese woman who stayed with a 92-year-old host in London: "When I was ready to leave, he said, 'if you treat me as your grandfather, give me a hug for goodbye.' So we hugged. Then, what he said really shocked me, 'I want to kiss your lips.' Of course I refused. But he explained, 'You don't understand. This is how a grandfather shows his love to his granddaughter in Europe. You are traveling here to experience local culture, aren't you? So you have to kiss me. This is part of European culture. </p>

                <p class="part1"> These experiences were well echoed by Jeanie, whom I met in June 2021 at the coding bootcamp we both did. An experienced Couchsurfer herself, she was immediately hooked on the idea and was my first co-founder. Due to her creative fashion studies and her related design skills, and her extremely fast grasp during the Coding Bootcamp, she is an incredibly valuable co-founder. I also met Marie at coding bootcamp, but she was in a later batch than Jeanie and I and was recommended to me by the teachers when asked. Through her experience at Too Good To Go as a Campaign Manager, her coding skills but most of all because of her open, critical and humorous personality, she enriches Quouch immensely.

                 <p class="part1">  We believe that Quouch will bring a whole new travel experience especially to women and non-heterosexual people by creating space for encounters that take place beyond potential sexual interactions. By taking a female and queer perspective, which by no means excludes other Quouch user:s, existing inequalities will be brought to the fore as well as a focus on setting and respecting boundaries. This happens in contrast to other platforms and companies that inherently operate under hetero-male normativity and thus reproduce biases in all areas - safety in travel not excluded. Or, as one article3 puts it, "This study argues that the discourse production is under a patriarchal system in which the experience about women's fear of men's harassment and according practice are concealed."

                    Since I studied Cognitive Science, the idea of adding an intelligent component to the app was obvious - namely a matching algorithm that introduces suitable users to each other based on parameters such as humor. In the course of this, I was lucky enough to meet Lisa again, whom I still knew from my studies, but who was a few semesters above me, had studied Computer Science and Cognitive Science at the same time and had furthered her education in the form of two masters in Machine Learning as well as Computer Science and subsequent work experience. Lisa is responsible for the algorithm that is at the heart of our app. In order for us to know the parameters according to which the algorithm has to be developed, i.e. the criteria according to which we want to match people, we were able to win Matthias Ziegler as a mentor, who conducts research in the field of customized personality tests and also has his own company that offers precisely this service. For us, this is perfect, because users are supposed to create their profile similar to clicking through a personality test and we thus have more meaningful data available than just "interests" or similar, which would be very superficial. By doing this, we want to allow our users to connect with each other on a deeper level. In the longer term, our algorithm can become relevant to any area of life where interpersonal relationships are paramount, such as team building .

                    In the background, we have already been able to inspire numerous supporters for Quouch, including the founder of ReDi School Anne Kjaer Riechert, European Young Leader 2020, former long-time Facebook (Meta) employee Ewelina Yildiz, who will assist us with online marketing campaigns, and Janika Abel, Head of Communication & Diversity Trainer at Impact of Diversity.
